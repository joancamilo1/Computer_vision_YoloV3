# YOLO-V3
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is an object detection algorithm, and YOLOv3 is its third iteration. It's a deep learning model that can detect and classify objects in images or video frames. What makes YOLO special is its speed and accuracyâ€”it can process images in real-time while accurately identifying multiple objects and their locations within the image. YOLOv3 improves upon its predecessors by introducing various architectural changes and enhancements, resulting in better performance and accuracy. Essentially, it's a powerful tool for tasks like surveillance, autonomous driving, and image analysis.
